Graphs

in this project we implemented  directional weighted graph.
we have 5 packages : dataStructure, gui, algorithms, Tests, utils.

dataStructure contains:
Dgraph - implements graph.
edge_data - interface.
Edge - implements edge_data.
graph - interface.
node_data - interface.
Node - implements node_data.

gui contains:
Graph_GUI implements Runnable (using thread to draw the graph).

Tests contains:
Ex2Test - boaz's test.
testingDgraph - Dgraph test.
testingGraph_Algo - Graph_Algo test.

utils contains:
Point3D,Range,StdDraw - we havn't changed them.
